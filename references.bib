  abstract = {Availability of magnesium is a matter of concern due to its role in many environmental and biological processes. Diffusive Gradients in Thin Films (DGT) devices can measure Mg availability in situ. This Work shows that Mg accumulation in water largely increases when ionic strength (I) decreases. This phenomenon can be explained from.(i) the increase of both the association equilibrium (K) and rate (k(a,R)) constants for the reaction between Mg cations and resin sites, and (ii) the growing contribution of the partitioning of Mg cations at the resin-gel interface, as I decreases. Two theoretical models that take into account electrical interactions among Mg cations, background electrolyte, and resin sites can successfully be used to determine k(a,R) and K at each I. Both models yield similar k(a,R) Values, which fulfill an expression for the kinetic salt effect. For freshwater (with a typical salinity of 10 mM and circumneutral pH), the binding of Mg is so fast and strong that the simplest perfect-sink DGT expression can be helpful to predict (overestimation lower than 5\%) the accumulation in solutions with Mg concentrations up to 1 mM whenever the deployment time is below 9 h. Perfect sink conditions can still be applied for longer times, in systems with either a lower I or a lower Mg concentration.},

  abstract = {Natural waters contain mixtures of ligands, which collectively affect the availability of trace metals. The individual contribution of each complex to the overall metal flux received by a sensor can be described in terms of its lability degree. The question arises as to whether the mixture entails specific non-additive effects, i.e. to what extent is it possible to predict the collective behaviour of the mixture from the values of the lability degree of each single ligand system (SLS). For this reason, a series of experiments with diffusion gradients in thin films (DGT) devices were carried out to measure nickel accumulation from synthetic media comprising either nitrilotriacetic acid (NTA), ethylenediamine (EN) or mixtures of both ligands. The results were compared with numerical simulations. It is shown that NiNTA becomes more inert in the mixture than in the SLS that contains the same concentration of free Ni and NiNTA, whereas the opposite is true for the Ni bound to EN, which becomes more labile in the mixture than in the SLS. This unprecedented behaviour arises when one of the ligands (NTA, forming strong and partially labile complexes) is present under non-excess conditions. As NiNTA and NiEN have an opposite influence on the lability degree of each other, the sum of partial fluxes calculated from the lability degrees obtained in SLSs yields a reasonable estimate of DGT performance in the mixture. Experimental accumulations in the mixture are just slightly below the predicted values, with errors lower than 11 \% when NTA concentrations vary from 20 to 100\% of the total Ni concentration.},

  abstract = {Time weighted average (TWA) concentrations can improve the assessment of water quality. DGT (Diffusive Gradients in Thin films) devices have been suggested as simple tools to measure TWA metal concentrations, but the connection of TWA with C-DGT has not been rigorously discussed. It is shown here that C-DGT is the average DGT-labile concentration along the deployment, which suggests that it is well suited to correlate with toxicity effects. In terms of real species, C-DGT is a good estimator of the TWA concentration for simple metal solutions (no ligands are present) when the accumulation takes place under perfect sink conditions. Differences between CDGT and the TWA concentration for short pulses ({$<$}40 min), when the transient regime becomes relevant, are reported. In the presence of complexes, C-DGT contains the TWA of the product of the labile fraction times the diffusivity of the complex (relative to that of the free metal). This means that C-DGT can underestimate the TWA of the total metal concentration due to the presence of complexes less mobile than the free metal or not fully labile. These findings are illustrated with Cd, Ni, Mg or Ni + nitrilotriacetic acid (NTA) solutions. When only one complex is relevant, as in the Ni + NTA system, a simple correction factor can yield the TWA concentration from C-DGT. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Apparent protonation constants were expressed as a function of a (dissociation degree) using the three parameter model proposed by Hogfeldt and the formation constants of Na+, Mg2+ and Ca2+ complexes were calculated from the differences in protonation constants in the different ionic media. The salt effects on protonation were interpreted in terms of both activity coefficient variations and cation complex formation. Enthalpy changes for protonation, obtained by direct calorimetry (always quite low, the stabilization being mainly of entropic nature), were also expressed as a function of alpha and I using empirical equations. The formation constants obtained for alkali and alkaline earth metal complexes are quite low for Na+ species (depending on a and on ionic strength, we always found K {$<$} 10 L mol(-1)), and fairly high for Mg2+ and Ca2+ species, ML and ML2.

For complexing agents with a large number of sites, very simple expressions for the stepwise stability constants arise. Such expressions are model-independent; that is, they allow the determination of the stepwise stability constants without making any previous assumption of the detailed complexation mechanism. The formalism is first presented for a single complexing ion and further extended to competitive systems where the competing ions can display, in general, different stoichiometric relationships. These ideas are applied to the analysis of experimental titrations corresponding to competitive binding of calcium ions to poly(acrylic acid) for different pH values and ionic strengths. Intrinsic stability constants were estimated from the stepwise stability constants (by removing the corresponding statistical factor), and split into specific and electrostatic contributions (by means of the Poisson-Boltzmann equation). After this treatment, the specific proton binding energies showed almost no dependence on the coverage and ionic strength. Likewise, for the range of concentrations studied, the specific component of the intrinsic stability constants of the calcium ions, calculated assuming bidentate binding of Ca to neighboring groups of a linear chain, is almost independent of the calcium and proton coverage and ionic strength.},

NICA (Non-Ideal Competitive Adsorption) isotherm has been used for a global quantitative description of the binding, which has then been interpreted by plotting the Conditional Affinity Spectra of the H+ binding at fixed total metal concentrations (CAScTM). This new physicochemical tool, here introduced, allows the interpretation of binding results in terms of distributions of proton binding energies. A large increase in the acidity of the phenolic sites as the total metal concentration increases, especially in presence of Pb, is revealed from the shift of the CAScTM towards lower affinities. The variance of the CAScTM distribution, which can be used as a direct measure of the heterogeneity, also shows a significant dependence on the total metal concentration. A discussion of the factors that influence the heterogeneity of the HA under the conditions of each experiment is provided, so that the smoothed pattern exhibited by the titration curves can be justified.

  abstract = {There is a current debate on whether the toxicity of engineered ZnO nanoparticles (NPs) can be traced back to their nanoscale properties or rather to the simple fact of their relatively high solubility and consequent release of Zn2+ ions. In this work, the emerging electroanalytical technique AGNES (Absence of Gradients and Nemstian Equilibrium Stripping), which is specially designed to determine free metal ion concentration, is shown to be able to measure the Zn2+ concentration resulting from dissolution of ZnO nanoparticles dispersed in aqueous salt solutions. Three NP samples from different sources (having average primary particle diameters of 6, 20, and 71 nm) were tested and compared with bulk ZnO material. The enhanced solubility of the nanoparticles with decreasing primary radius allows for an estimation of the surface energy of 0.32 J/m(2). AGNES also allows the study of the kinetics of Zn2+ release as a response to a change in the solution parameters (e.g., pH, ZnO concentration). A physicochemical model has been developed to account for the observed kinetic behavior. With this model, only one kinetic parameter is required to describe the time dependence of the free Zn2+ concentration in solution. Good agreement with this prediction is obtained when, starting from an equilibrated NP dispersion, the pH of the medium is lowered. Also, the independence of this parameter from pH, as expected from the model, is obtained at least in the pH range 7-9. When dissolution is studied by dispersing ZnO nanoparticles in the medium, the kinetic parameter initially decreases with time. This decrease can be interpreted as resulting from the increase of the radius of the clusters due to the agglomeration/aggregation phenomena (independently confirmed). For the larger assayed NPs (i.e., 20 and 71 nm), a sufficiently large pH increase leads to a metastable solubility state, suggesting formation of a hydroxide interfacial layer.},

Under these conditions, ZnO NPs are chemically unstable due to their reaction with phosphates. The initial stage of transformation (around 5-10 h) involves the formation of a metastable solid (presumably ZnHPO4), which later evolves into the more stable hopeite phase. The overall decay rate of ZnO NPs is significantly reduced in comparison with phosphate-free background solutions of the same ionic strength and pH. The effective equilibrium solubilities of ZnO (0.29-0.47 mg.L-1), as well as conditional excess-ligand stability constants and fractional distributions of soluble Zn species, were determined in the absence and presence of organic components. The results were compared with the conventional ultrafiltration and inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (UF-ICP-MS) methodology.

This fact, however, does not hinder the possibility of a correct determination of the free metal concentration in the solution with AGNES (Absence of Gradients and Nernstian Equilibrium Stripping). The equilibrium state (the target situation aimed at the end of the deposition stage of AGNES) is not disturbed by induced adsorption, while different strategies (e.g. the use of charge as stripping analytical signal) can avoid a possible kinetic interference on the quantification stage. The impact of adsorption on the blanks proves to be very small and, if needed, it could be further minimized by choosing a sufficiently high gain or variants of AGNES (such as AGNELSV or AGNES-SCP) that do not require the explicit subtraction of the blank. Some surfactants in solution, even without complexing the metal, might block the electrode surface, so that refined methodologies have to be used in such systems. In the case of the dispersant accompanying Nanotek ZnO nanoparticles, the complete blocking of the electrode can be reached in around 100 s, and, thus, electrodes with renovating drops are key for dealing with such kind of difficulties. The free Zn concentration in equilibrium with these nanoparticles determined by AGNES (with minimization of the deposition times and suppression of any stirring) is consistent with the one expected according to its primary particle size.

  abstract = {The speciation of trace metals in an aquatic system involves the determination of free ions, complexes (labile and non-labile), colloids, and the total dissolved concentration. In this paper, we review the integrated assessment of free ions and labile metal complexes using Diffusive Gradients in Thin-films (DGT), a dynamic speciation technique. The device consists of a diffusive hydrogel layer made of polyacrylamide, backed by a layer of resin (usually Chelex-100) for all trace metals except for Hg. The best results for Hg speciation are obtained with agarose as hydrogel and a thiol-based resin. The diffusive domain controls the diffusion flux of the metal ions and complexes to the resin, which strongly binds all free ions. By using DGT devices with different thicknesses of the diffusive or resin gels and exploiting expressions derived from kinetic models, one can determine the labile concentrations, mobilities, and labilities of different species of an element in an aquatic system. This procedure has been applied to the determination of the organic pool of trace metals in freshwaters or to the characterization of organic and inorganic complexes in sea waters. The concentrations that are obtained represent time-weighted averages (TWA) over the deployment period.},

  abstract = {The ionization state of charged macromolecules in solution is usually determined by the extent of the binding processes. These processes are very sensitive to the ionic strength of the medium, which are of long-range nature. The ionization properties of weak polyelectrolytes can be described by means of Ising-type models, which is only feasible when long-range interactions are neglected. Here, this formalism is extended to include long-range interactions by introducing a modified free energy involving only effective short-range interaction parameters. These parameters can be systematically calculated by using the Gibbs-Bogoliubov variational principle. The technique is illustrated with the calculation of titration curves of homogeneous and heterogeneous polyelectrolytes in a wide range of ionic strengths. The correction of the site protonation free energy (first order correction) is enough to obtain an excellent agreement between theory and Monte Carlo simulations. Corrections to other cluster parameters (higher-order corrections) are also implemented. In general, the correction to a particular parameter represents the average change in the long-range energy when a new interaction is created in the polyelectrolyte. The method presented here represents an improvement in the description of the ionization state of polyelectrolytes that can be relevant in a wide range of areas. (c) 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J.

  abstract = {The ability of Cystoseira baccata algal biomass to remove Hg(II) from aqueous solutions is investigated. The mercury biosorption process is studied through batch experiments at 25 degrees C with regard to the influence of contact time, initial mercury concentration, solution pH, salinity and presence of several divalent cations. The acid-base properties of the alga are also studied, since they are related to the affinity for heavy metals. The studies of the pH effect on the metal uptake evidence a sharp increasing sorption up to a pH value around 7.0, which can be ascribed to changes both in the inorganic Hg(II) speciation and in the dissociation state of the acid algal sites. The sorption isotherms at constant pH show uptake values as high as 178 mg g(-1) (at pH 4.5) and 329 mg g(-1) (at pH 6.0). The studies of the salinity influence on the Hg(II) sorption capacity of the alga exhibit two opposite effects depending on the electrolyte added; an increase in concentration of nitrate salts (NaNO3, KNO3) Slightly enhances the metal uptake, on the contrary, the addition of NaCl salt leads to a drop in the sorption. The addition of different divalent cations to the mercury solution, namely Ca2+, Mg2+, Zn2+, Cd2+, Pb2+ and Cu2+, reveals that their effect on the uptake process is negligible. Finally, the equilibrium sorption results are compared with predictions obtained from the application of a simple competitive chemical model, which involves a discrete proton binding constant and three additional constants for the binding of the main neutral inorganic Hg(II) complexes, Hg(Cl)(2), HgOHCl and Hg(OH)(2), to the algal surface sites.

  abstract = {Binding resin beads used in DGT (diffusion gradients in thin films) tend to settle to one side of the resin during casting. This phenomenon might be relevant for metal accumulation when partially labile complexes dominate the metal speciation, especially after recognizing the important role played by complex dissociation in the resin domain. The influence of the inhomogeneity of the binding agent distribution on metal accumulation is here assessed by numerical simulation of DGT devices with binding beads in only one half of the resin disc, as a reasonable model of the standard resin discs. Results indicate that a decrease in mass accumulation of less than 13\% can arise in these inhomogeneous devices (as compared with an ideal disc with homogeneous dispersion of the resin beads) when complexes with stability constant K {$<$} 10(2) m(3) mol(-1) (K {$<$} 10(5) L mol(-1)) dominate the metal speciation. The loss increases as K increases, but the percentage of mass loss always remains lower than the volume fraction of resin disc without beads. For very labile or inert complexes, the impact of the inhomogeneous distribution of binding resin beads is negligible. As kinetic dissociation constants of complexes can be estimated from the distribution of the metal accumulation in a DGT device with a stack of two resin discs, the influence of the inhomogeneity on the recovered kinetic constant is also assessed. For the cases studied, the recovered kinetic dissociation constant, k(d,recovered), retains the correct order of magnitude, being related to the true k(d) by k(d) approximate to f(-1) k(d,recovered), quite independently of K and k(d) values, being f the fraction of volume of the resin disc where resin beads are dispersed.

  abstract = {DGT (Diffusion Gradients in Thin films) was designed to sample trace metals in situ at their natural concentrations. The setup and the experimental deployment conditions were established to allow interpretation of a linear accumulation of metal with time, using a simple expression based on a steady-state flux under perfect sink conditions. However, the extension of DGT to a wide range of analytes and its use under varied conditions has shown that, in some situations, these conditions are not fulfilled, so that accumulations with time are nonlinear. Previously, when such curvature was observed, concentrations in solution could not be reliably calculated. Here, we present fundamentally derived equations that reproduce the time accumulation for three situations: (i) kinetic limitations in the binding to the resin, (ii) saturation or equilibrium effects, or (iii) non-negligible competitive effects. We show how the accumulations can be quantified, in terms of the required kinetic and thermodynamic constants, and provide practical guidance for their use to obtain reliable estimates of solution concentrations. Solutions containing Mg or Mn, where all three situations can prevail, are used as examples. Calculated concentrations show reasonable agreement with the experimentally known values and with the results of a numerical model of the system, significantly improving, the estimations based on perfect sink conditions., Such an approach opens up the possibility of using DGT more widely in challenging systems and allows DGT data to be interpreted more fully.},

  abstract = {Protonated biomass of the seaweed Sargassum muticum was investigated for its ability to remove cadmium(II) from aqueous solutions. In this work, a nonideal, semiempirical, thermodynamically consistent (NICCA) isotherm was proposed to fit the experimental ion binding data obtained in NaNO3 0.05 mol L-1. This model describes the competition between protons and metal ions satisfactorily. Moreover, it reflects the complexity of the macromolecular systems that take part in biosorption considering the heterogeneity of the sorbent. It was demonstrated in this work that the NICCA isotherm constitutes a great improvement with respect to a simpler Langmuir competitive equation, which was not able to describe all the experimental data satisfactorily. Potentiometric acid-base titrations in the absence of cadmium were made to estimate the maximum amount of acid functional groups (2.61 mmol g(-1)) and the conditional proton binding parameters, log (K) over tilde (H) (3.8) and m(H) (0.54). The values of the binding parameters for the cadmium ion were chosen to provide the best simultaneous description of the isotherm at pH 4.5, as well as the dependence of cadmium adsorption on pH. Values of log (K) over tilde (Cd) (3.1), n(Cd) (1.8), and p (0.19) in the case of the NICCA isotherm or log K-Cd (2.94-3.4) for Langmuir competitive models were obtained. Kinetic experiments were performed at two different pH values (3.0 and 4.5), establishing the time dependence that represents the sorption of cadmium with a pseudo-second-order kinetic model. It was observed that 4 h is enough to ensure that the equilibrium uptake was reached. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Representative organic coatings i.e. tannic acid (TA), alginic acid (ALG), two gum Arabic samples (GAL and GAH), branched polyethylenimine (BPEI), and non-ionic surfactants (reference material NM-300K) were selected to cover a wide range of zeta-potentials. The stability in NaCl solutions, as determined from the rate of variation in hydrodynamic size within a timeframe of one hour, followed the order BPEI {$>>$} NM-300K approximate to GAL {$>>$} ALG approximate to TA {$>>$} GAH. In the seawater samples the order was NM-300K approximate to GAL {$>>$} ALG {$>$} GAH {$>$} TA approximate to BPEI, and only TA, GAL and NM-300K batches behaved as expected from the NaCl experiments. Remarkably, the BPEI sample showed the largest aggregation rate in the seawater sample with the highest DOM concentration (277 mu M C). The GAH sample displayed a non-monotonic variation in aggregation rate with NaCl concentration, apparently due to concomitant precipitation of AgCl. The results indicate that non-electrostatic stabilization mechanisms and DOM-coating interactions are important for the prediction of stability and persistence of polymer-coated AgNPs in seawater.

  abstract = {Marine dissolved organic matter (DOM) plays a key role in the current and future global carbon cycle, which supports life on Earth. Tracemetals such as iron, an essential micronutrient, competewith protons andmajor ions for the binding to DOM. These competitive effects and the DOM binding capacity are related to the DOM acid-base properties, which also influence DOM transport and reactivity in marine waters. Here we present the results of a complete set of acid-base titration experiments of a pre-concentrated marine DOM sample in the range 0.01 {$<$}= I {$<$}= 0.7 M and 3 {$<$}= pH {$<$}= 10. We characterize the obtained proton binding curves using a combination of the non-ideal competitive adsorption (NICA) isothermand Donnan electrostatic model. Within the main chemical groups of marine DOM, the carboxylic distribution was accurately characterized from the obtained data (Q(maxH, 1) = 2.52 mol.kg(-1), log((k) over barH,1) = 3.26, m(1) = 0.69 and b = 0.70). This carboxylic mode was found to be less acidic andmore homogeneous than a generic fulvic acid, but the differences are consistentwith the reported variability of fulvic acids of freshwater and terrestrial origin. We find that changes in temperature (down to 5.5 degrees C), and the presence of calciumor magnesium(at 0.01 M) resulted in no significant modification of the proton ion binding curves obtained at 25 degrees C and 0.7 or 0.1 M ionic strength, respectively. We demonstrate the relevance of proton binding parameters for the modelling of the system iron/marine DOM throughout a wide range of salinity and acidity conditions in the context of different future ocean scenarios.

  abstract = {ABSTRACT: The physicochemical characteristics of dissolved organic matter (DOM) strongly influence its interactions with inorganic species such as protons and trace elements in natural waters. We collected water samples at Boknis Eck, a time series station in the Baltic Sea with a low exposure to freshwater inputs, to investigate how seasonal fluctuations impact the proton binding properties of the isolated DOM. We used potentiometric titrations to assess the binding properties of solid-phase extracted DOM (SPE−DOM) over a seasonal cycle. We report and critically analyze the first NICA parameters estimates of carboxylic-like and phenolic-like sites for brackish water SPE−DOM. The total amount of fluctuations functional groups and an average value (QmaxH,tot) showed no of 136 ± 5.2 mmol·mol seasonal C−1. The average proton affinity (logKH) and binding site heterogeneity (m) showed a relatively minor variability for samples obtained between April and September, when the water remained stratified. These results contribute to a better understanding of the ion binding characteristics of DOM in natural brackish waters.},

Variations in the number of hydroxyl groups, quantified by potentiometric titrations, and CO2 evolution during experiments, were attributed mainly to the oxidation of hydroxylic entities present in the studied material. The results indicate that these groups together with the carboxylic moieties are the main functionalities involved on the adsorption-coupled reduction process. The column experiment carried out provides a new approach to obtain the maximum reduction capacity of the material (3.72 mmol g(-1)). Moreover, we hereby propose a model that reports the first evidence for the instant bound of Cr(III) species to the material used, formed after the reduction of Cr(VI) present in solution. The removal process was quantified carrying out experiments under various pHs, biomass doses and Cr(VI) concentrations, and the mechanism underlying chromium removal was identified.

The polyelectrolyte titrations were simulated by calculating the degree of ionization versus pH curves at two ionic strengths. The results allow us to quantify the impact of the sizes of the background salt ions and surface functional groups of the polyelectrolyte on the dissociation degree.

  abstract = {In this paper, we present a computer simulation study of the ion binding process at an ionizable surface using a semi-grand canonical Monte Carlo method that models the surface as a discrete distribution of charged and neutral functional groups in equilibrium with explicit ions modelled in the context of the primitive model. The parameters of the simulation model were tuned and checked by comparison with experimental titrations of carboxylated latex particles in the presence of different ionic strengths of monovalent ions. The titration of these particles was analysed by calculating the degree of dissociation of the latex functional groups vs. pH curves at different background salt concentrations. As the charge of the titrated surface changes during the simulation, a procedure to keep the electroneutrality of the system is required. Here, two approaches are used with the choice depending on the ion selected to maintain electroneutrality: counterion or coion procedures. We compare and discuss the difference between the procedures. The simulations also provided a microscopic description of the electrostatic double layer (EDL) structure as a function of pH and ionic strength. The results allow us to quantify the effect of the size of the background salt ions and of the surface functional groups on the degree of dissociation. The non-homogeneous structure of the EDL was revealed by plotting the counterion density profiles around charged and neutral surface functional groups. (C) 2011 American Institute of Physics.

  abstract = {A key question for the practical application of DGT (Diffusive Gradients in Thin films) as dynamic sensors in the environmental monitoring of trace metals is the influence of pH and dissolved ligands over the linear accumulation regime. Protons compete with metal ions for the binding to the DGT resin sites at relatively low pH, whereas high affinity dissolved ligands compete with resin sites for the binding of metals. Any of the two phenomena can lead to a departure from the linear accumulation regime and an underestimation of the actual species concentration in solution. These effects are studied here through numerical simulation of the diffusion-reaction processes in both gel and resin domains using a detailed chemical model of metal ions and protons interacting with resin sites. Results were tested successfully against experimental data of the Cd-NTA representative system. Charts to delimitate the range of experimental conditions (pH, ligand concentration and strength) where the linear accumulation regime prevails, can be helpful for designing sampling strategies in field conditions. For example, it is foreseen that perturbations of linear regime within 10 h of deployment are negligible above pH 5 and weak complexation (log K' {$<$} 0) or above pH 7 and strong complexation (log K' {$<$} 3), where K' is the effective stability constant. These plots can also be approximately used for partially labile systems whenever the time is replaced with the product lability degree times t.},

  abstract = {ZnO nanoparticles (NPs) are prone to dissolution, and uncertainty remains whether biological/cellular responses to ZnO NPs are solely due to the release of Zn2+ or whether the NPs themselves have additional toxic effects. We address this by establishing ZnO NP solubility in dispersion media (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, DMEM) held under conditions identical to those employed for cell culture (37 degrees C, 5\% CO2, and pH 7.68) and by systematic comparison of cell NP interaction for three different ZnO NP preparations. For NPs at concentrations up to 5.5 mu g ZnO/mL, dissolution is complete (with the majority of the soluble zinc complexed to dissolved ligands in the medium), taking ca. 1 h for uncoated and ca. 6 h for polymer coated ones. Above 5.5 mu g/mL, the results are consistent with the formation of zinc carbonate, keeping the solubilized zinc fixed to 67 mu M of which only 0.45 mu M is as free Zn2+, i.e., not complexed to dissolved ligands. At these relatively high concentrations, NPs with an aliphatic polyether-coating show slower dissolution (i.e., slower free Zn2+ release) and reprecipitation kinetics compared to those of uncoated NPs, requiring more than 48 h to reach thermodynamic equilibrium. Cytotoxicity (MTT) and DNA damage (Comet) assay dose response curves for three epithelial cell lines suggest that dissolution and reprecipitation dominate for uncoated ZnO NPs. Transmission electron microscopy combined with the monitoring of intracellular Zn2+ concentrations and ZnO NP interactions with model lipid membranes indicate that an aliphatic polyether coat on ZnO NPs increases cellular uptake, enhancing toxicity by enabling intracellular dissolution and release of Zn2+. Similarly, we demonstrate that needle-like NP morphologies enhance toxicity by apparently frustrating cellular uptake. To limit toxicity, ZnO NPs with nonacicular morphologies and coatings that only weakly interact with cellular membranes are recommended.},

  abstract = {The properties of the NICA (non-ideal competitive adsorption) isotherm are examined from the point of view of the underlying conditional affinity spectra (CAS), the distribution of effective affinities seen by a given metal ion at a fixed pH. it is shown that a CAS underlying NICA isotherm exists for all combinations of p- and n(i)-values including cases with different n(i)-values for the competing species (protons and metal ions). These distributions shift towards lower affinity values and change their shape as pH decreases. For instance, the conditional distributions can show two peaks within a monomodal NICA isotherm with quite negative minimum skewness, preferably for low enough p-values. Analytical expressions and a full discussion of this behaviour are reported with the aim of providing a complementary understanding of the physical meaning of the NICA parameters. Parameter p mainly influences the correlation between the binding energies of the competing ions. In general, when there is no multidimensional affinity spectrum, low p-values are usually associated with strong affinity sites for the proton tending to be involved in high affinity sites for the metal (i.e. there is correlation in a broad sense). The rate of shift of the average conditional affinity with pH is mainly determined by the proton affinities and the stoichiometric relationship, n(M)/n(H), which determines the proton/metal ion exchange work.

In the experimental conditions, the amount of resin sites are in excess with respect to the amount of metal ion, leading to extensive depletion of metal in bulk solution when equilibrium is reached. The data were described using a mixed control mass transport model in finite volume conditions (MCM) that includes explicitly both intraparticle and film diffusion steps. Exact numerical computations and a new approximate analytical expression of this model are reported here. MCM successfully predicts the influence of pH and ionic strength on the experimental Cd(II)/Chelex kinetic profiles (which cannot be justified by a pure film diffusion controlled mechanism) with a minimum number of fitting parameters. The overall diffusion coefficient inside the resin was modelled in terms of the Donnan factor and the resin/cation binding stability constant. The values of the latter coefficient as a function of pH and ionic strength were estimated from the Gibbs-Donnan model. Even though MCM is numerically more involved than models exclusively restricted to film or intraparticle diffusion control, it proves to be accurate in a wider range of values of the mass transfer Biot number and solution/resin metal ratios.

  abstract = {The dynamic ion exchange technique (DIET) is proposed to provide speciation information, which can be used to establish links with metal bioavailability in natural waters. The experimental setup consists of a few milligrams of a sulfonic acid type ion exchange resin packed in a plastic microcolumn that is coupled to a peristaltic pump for a sample to interact with the resin which is subsequently eluted. The evolution of both the accumulated number of moles in the resin and the concentration of the effluent can provide information on the dissociation of different metal-ligand complexes when compared with the transport properties. This information can be converted into the lability degree of a given complex or the DIET concentration c(DIET), which accounts for the labile fraction contributing to the metal accumulation by the resin column at the operation conditions. c(DIET) can be extended to columns containing chelating resins (such as those with Chelex) or to chromatography. A comprehensive modelling of the involved phenomena (such as diffusion, advection, reaction kinetics and electrostatic partitioning) leads to the quantitative interpretation of the accumulation time series (accumulation curves) or effluent evolution (breakthrough curves). Particularly simple analytical expressions can be used for short exposure times, when a (quasi) steady-state is attained. These models have been checked against the results from complexes of Cu and Ni with ligands, such as ethylenediamine, and ethylenediaminetetraacetic, iminodiacetic, glutamic, salicylic, malonic and malic acids, which yield complexes with contrasting charges. Caution is advised when estimating the free metal fraction from DIET measurements, as c(DIET) and the free metal concentration can be considered to be equal only in the case of extremely inert complexes.},

  abstract = {Brown seaweeds are interesting materials to be used as biosorbents for heavy metals due to their high binding ability and low cost. The study of the passive biosorption of protons on this kind of materials and its dependency on pH, ionic strength, and medium composition is essential for the practical application of brown algae in wastewater treatment. This work reports the results of the study of the proton binding equilibria of dead biomass from the seaweeds Sargassum muticum, Cystoseira baccata, an Saccorhiza polyschides by potentiometric titration with glass electrode in the pH range between 2 and 8. Two different salts, NaCl and KNO3, in concentrations ranging from 0.05 to 2 mol(.)L(-1), were used as background electrolytes. The influence of the ionic strength was accounted for by means of the Donnan model in combination with the master curve approach. Different empirical expressions to describe the swelling behavior of the biosorbent were tested. On the basis of the intrinsic affinity distribution analysis a unimodal Langmuir-Freundlich isotherm was selected to describe the proton binding properties. The results show very little influence of the type of salt. The ionic strength dependency of the proton binding is very similar for the three species, and average empirical expressions of the Donnan volume are proposed. The maximum proton binding capacities obtained ranged between 2.4 and 2.9 mol(.)kg(-1), with average intrinsic proton affinity constants between 3.1 and 3.3, and heterogeneity parameters of ca. 0.5 for S. muticum and C. baccata, and slightly higher (ca. 0.7) for S. polyschides. The combined Langmuir-Freundlich equation and Donnan model allowed a good description of the experimental charge vs pH curves obtained.},

These models should be able to account for the polyelectrolytic properties of these materials, and to reasonably describe and predict the ionic strength effect. Data regarding the proton binding equilibria of Sargassum muticum, Cystoseira baccata and Saccorhiza polyschides in NaCl and KNO3 were reported on a preceding paper. These data are re-analysed in this work, in order to compare two different electrostatic models (surface charge and Donnan models), representing two opposite idealised interface structures (planar surface and permeable gel). Simple analytical equations relating the apparent pK with both the dissociation degree and the ionic strength are derived for each case. The experimental data are reproduced with similar accuracy by the surface charge and the simplest Donnan model (rigid volume), although the latter seems to yield slightly better results. The comparison of the geometric parameters involved in each model (Donnan volume and specific area) with independent experimental measurements is not straightforward. Therefore, both models seem to be almost equivalent, within their respective assumptions. Nevertheless, Donnan has the advantage that provides a simple way to account for activity coefficient effects and non-specific binding.},

The Green-Kubo relations were employed to evaluate the transport coefficients. When compared with available experimental data, the model underestimates the conductivity and self- diffusion, whereas the viscosity is overpredicted, showing only a semiquantitative agreement with experimental data. These discrepancies are explained on the basis of the rigidity and lack of polarizability of the model. Despite this, the experimental trends with temperature are remarkably well reproduced, with a good agreement on the activation energies when available. No significant deviations from the Nernst- Einstein relation can be assessed on the basis of the statistical uncertainty of the simulations, although the comparison between the electric current and the velocity autocorrelation functions suggests some degree of cross- correlation among ions in a short time scale. The simulations reproduce remarkably well the slope of the Walden plots obtained from experimental data of 1- ethyl- 3- methylimidazolium chloride, confirming that temperature does not alter appreciably the extent of ion pairing.},

The Green-Kubo relationships were employed to evaluate the cation/anion diffusion coefficients, electrical conductivity and shear viscosity at 400 K. The ILs investigated were 1-ethyl-3-methytimidazolium salts of Cl-, NO3- and PF6- using two different force fields for the cation: a rigid ion model of 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium, studied in a previous work [C. Rey-Castro, L.F. Vega, J. Phys. Chem. B 110 (2006) 14426-14435] and the flexible model of Urahata and Ribeirc, [S.M. Urahata, M.C.C. Ribeiro, J. Chem. Phys. 120 (2004) 1855-18631. Regarding the anions, the most evident difference between the local structures in the three ILs is the position of the first peak of the radial distribution function, reflecting the differences in anion sizes and shapes. The velocity autocorrelation functions are particularly sensitive to the relative weights of anion and cation, although the integrated self-diffusion coefficients do not show significant differences between the Cl-, NO3- and PF6- salts. The electric conductivity predicted by the rigid ion model of [emimjCI is lower than the experimental value, whereas the model overestimates the viscosities. In contrast, the flexible model leads to diffusion rates and conductivities that are one order of magnitude higher at the same temperature. The shear viscosities obtained from simulations of the flexible model are in very good agreement with experimental data. The calculated conductivities are compared with values obtained from the diffusion coefficients through the Nernst-Einstein relation in order to determine the importance of cross-correlation among ions. The stress tensor and the distinct van Hove correlation functions indicate that the dynamics of the local structure of the fluid relaxes faster in the flexible model. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

Based on the experimental measurements, the isothermal surface tension of all IL-gas systems studied decreases as the pressure increases, evidencing a gas adsorption at the IL interface. Isobaric surface tension of an IL-gas does not show a general pattern as the temperature increases. In order to verify the isothermal surface behavior, the relative Gibbs adsorption isotherms have been calculated from the surface tension data by using the theoretical Guggenheim model, corroborating the gas adsorption processes at the IL interface. Comparing the relative Gibbs adsorption isotherms, it is possible to conclude that the ILs studied have the capability to adsorb more carbon dioxide than argon. This fact provides relevant information to use the IL as a capturing agent for carbon dioxide and the use of argon to store pure ILs.},

  abstract = {A sample of ombrotrophic peat from Moor House in northern England was extensively extracted with dilute nitric acid (pH 1) to free it of bound cations. Suspensions of the acid-washed peat (5-30 g l(-1)), prepared with different concentrations of background electrolyte (NaCl and KCl), were used to conduct batch acid-base titrations. A strong dependence of proton release on ionic strength (I) was observed, the apparent acid dissociation constant (pK(app)) being found to decrease by approximately 1.0 for each tenfold increase in I. This behaviour could not be explained satisfactorily with Humic Ion-Binding Model VI, a discrete-site/electrostatic model of cation binding by humic substances, parameterized with data from laboratory studies on isolated samples. More success was obtained by abandoning the impermeable-sphere electrostatic submodel used in Model VI, and instead assuming the peat to consist of aggregates with fixed internal volume, and with counterion accumulation described by the Donnan model, as proposed by Marinsky and colleagues. The fixed-volume Donnan model (Model VI-FD) could also approximately explain other reported results from acid-base titrations of peat, including the effects on the titrations of complexing cations (Al, Ca, Cu). Copper titrations of the Moor House sample were performed using an ion-selective electrode, with peat suspensions in the acid pH range, at two ionic strengths, and in the presence of Al and Ca. The measured concentrations of Cu2+ were in the range 10(-13)-10(-5) M. Model VI-FD provided reasonable fits of the experimental data, after optimization of the intrinsic binding constant for Cu, the optimized value being close to the default value derived previously from data referring to isolated humic substances. The optimized constants for Al and Ca, derived from their competition effects, were also close to their default values. Additional experiments were performed in which the centrifugation-depletion method was used to measure the binding of a cocktail of metals (Al, Ni, Cu, Zn, Cd, Eu, Pb) at a single pH. The model correctly predicted strong binding of Al, Cu, Eu and Pb, and weaker binding of Ni, Zn and Cd. For the strongly binding metals, the dissolved forms were calculated to be mainly due to complexes with dissolved humic matter, whereas the free ions (Ni2+, Zn2+, Cd2+) dominated for the weakly binding metals. Acid-washed soil appears to provide a valuable intermediate between isolated humic substances and untreated soil for the investigation of cation binding by natural organic matter in the natural environment.},

  abstract = {Solubility is an important physicochemical parameter in nanoregulation. If nanomaterial is completely soluble, then from a risk assessment point of view, its disposal can be treated much in the same way as ordinary chemicals, which will simplify testing and characterisation regimes. This review assesses potential techniques for the measurement of nanomaterial solubility and evaluates the performance against a set of analytical criteria (based on satisfying the requirements as governed by the cosmetic regulation as well as the need to quantify the concentration of free (hydrated) ions). Our findings show that no universal method exists. A complementary approach is thus recommended, to comprise an atomic spectrometry-based method in conjunction with an electrochemical (or colorimetric) method. This article shows that although some techniques are more commonly used than others, a huge research gap remains, related with the need to ensure data reliability.},

  abstract = {Published experimental data for Al(III) and Fe(Ill) binding by fulvic and humic acids can be explained approximately by the Humic Ion-Binding Model VI. The model is based on conventional equilibrium reactions involving protons, metal aquo ions and their first hydrolysis products, and binding sites ranging from abundant ones of low affinity, to rare ones of high affinity, common to all metals. The model can also account for laboratory competition data involving Al(III), Fe(III) and trace elements, supporting the assumption of common binding sites. Field speciation data (116 examples) for Al in acid-to-neutral waters can be accounted for, assuming that 60-70 \% (depending upon competition by iron, and the chosen fulvic acid : humic acid ratio) of the dissolved organic carbon (DOC) is due to humic substances, the rest being considered inert with respect to ion binding. After adjustment of the model parameter characterizing binding affinity within acceptable limits, and with the assumption of equilibrium with a relatively soluble form of Fe(OH)(3), the model can simulate the results of studies of two freshwater samples, in which concentrations of organically complexed Fe were estimated by kinetic analysis. The model was used to examine the pH dependence of Al and Fe binding by dissolved organic matter (DOM) in freshwaters, by simulating the titration with Ca(OH)(2) of an initially acid solution, in equilibrium with solid-phase Al(OH)(3) and Fe(OH)(3). For the conditions considered, Al, which is present at higher free concentrations than Fe(III), competes significantly for the binding of Fe(III), whereas Fe(III) has little effect on Al binding. The principal form of Al simulated to be bound at low pH is Al3+, AlOH2+ being dominant at pH {$>$}6; the principal bound form of Fe(III) is FeOH2+ at all pH values in the range 4-9. Simulations suggest that, in freshwaters, both Al and Fe(III) compete significantly with trace metals (Cu, Zn) for binding by natural organic matter over a wide pH range (4-9). The competition effects are especially strong for a high-affinity trace metal such as Cu, present at low total concentrations (similar to1 nM). As a result of these competition effects, high-affinity sites in humic matter may be less important for trace metal binding in the field than they are in laboratory systems involving humic matter that has been treated to remove associated metals.
